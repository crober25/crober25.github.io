        First, one must download and install the software program - ATOM which allows the individual to create HTML documents to then be uploaded to the interweb. Once this program is in use, the need for a GitHub account becomes apparent. Once the user has created
        an account, they can now create a repository which is a file of live documents that can be displayed on a web page. Once this is created, the user must clone the repository (live folder on GitHub) onto their local computer so that the working
        files can be reognized and transferred to the live repository using a digital bridge known as GitHub Desktop which must be downloaded on the local computer. GitHub Desktop allows for the files placed in the local repository can now be seen as
        changes made to the file and must be documented and committed to the Master file so that the new file can be synced and transferred to the live version of the same folder (the repo) These files can now be viewed and uploaded to the web using the
        live repository found on GitHub.
